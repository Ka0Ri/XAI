    "Captum (“comprehension” in Latin) is an open source, extensible library for model interpretability built on PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captum provides state-of-the-art algorithms, including Integrated Gradients, to provide researchers and developers with an easy way to understand which features are contributing to a model’s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captum helps ML researchers more easily implement interpretability algorithms that can interact with PyTorch models. For model developers, Captum can be used to improve and troubleshoot models by facilitating the identification of different features that contribute to a model’s output in order to design better models and troubleshoot unexpected model outputs."
